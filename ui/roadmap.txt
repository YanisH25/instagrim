Remaining work:
    - Show either a sign-in and sign-up icon if not authenticated or a log-out icon if authenticated
    - Show the user's avatar instead of the account icon
    - Make the search bar works, meaning it should fetch the matching users and display them in a drop-down list,
      the users should be formatted as follow:
        1 - Avatar
        2 - Full Name
        3 - Username
        4 - A shorter version of his bio (20 characters or so)
